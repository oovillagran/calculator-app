      Hello Friends! "Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:
    </p>
    <ul
      class="lists"
    >
      <li>
        Make simple calculations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read a random math-related quote.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p
      class="home-text"
    >
      By building this application, I learned how to use React.
      <br />
      This application includes three subpages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Home Page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Calculator Page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quote Page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p
      class="home-text"
    >
      By building this application I was able to further strengthen my knowledge in JavaScript and had the opportunity to start working using React.
      <br />
      <br />
      React is a really wonderfull library that allows developers working in a more efficient way.
      <br />
      Among the main features used for the creation of this application are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Setting up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop React components.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect to an API within a functional component.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
